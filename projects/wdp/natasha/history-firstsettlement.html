                        <p><em>Discovered by Captain James Cook RN in 1774, Norfolk island was settled on 6 March 1788, six weeks after the First Fleet landed in Sydney...</em></p>
                        <p>Cook reported the island had rich soils, tall pines suitable for ships masts and spars, and native flax that could be used for making canvas. Governor Philip had instructions to settle and secure the island as soon as possible to secure its potential naval supplies. The First Settlement at Norfolk Island was organised along similar lines to its mainland counterpart in New South Wales and men and women settlers were allowed. A settlement was established at Kingston, with crops sown in the adjoining valley, Arthurs vale. To relieve the food pressures in the infant colony of New South Wales, Governor Philip relocated around one-third of Sydney’s population to Kingston.</p>
                        <p>Arriving on the Supply, Lieutenant Philip Gidley King RN and a party of nine male and six female convicts and seven staff established a settlement named Kingston. Both convicts and free settlers farmed small holdings of land. The first settlement’s population peaked at 1156 in May 1792. By 1804, the free settlers on the island significantly outnumbered the convicts who represented 23 per cent of the total population of 1084.

                        </figure>
                        <p>By 1806, the evacuation of the island was ordered. At that time, the population was around 700, the majority of whom were free settlers. The free settlers were gradually relocated to Van Diemen’s Land where some settled on the Norfolk Plains near Longford and others at New Norfolk on the Derwent. Abandoned in 1814, the settlement’s buildings were destroyed.</p>
                        <p>The First Penal Settlement was constructed surrounding the landing place, so little above ground evidence remains of most of these structures which were probably constructed of ephemeral materials, in particular, wattle and grass or a vernacular form of weatherboarding. The destruction, including burning, of the township at the close of the First Settlement obliterated these buildings. Traces of the foundations of these buildings survive in the archaeological evidence. Erosion of the foreshore areas over time has contributed to the loss of evidence.</p>
                        <p>Places within KAVHA where there is considerable archaeological potential for evidence of the First Settlement include:</p>
                        <ul class="page-list">
                            <li>In the vicinity of Kingston Pier and the Landing Area;</li>
                            <li>Beneath the site of the Prisoner’s Compound and Lumberyard (First Penal Settlement hospital, surgeon’s quarter’s and hospital garden);</li>
                            <li>Emily Bay (series of buildings, one labelled 'Beachmaster' on early plans);</li>
                            <li>Cutting into Flagstaff Hill (possible First Settlement drains);</li>
                            <li>The site of the First Penal Settlement timberyard and sawpits is yet to be determined;</li>
                            <li>The Lime Kiln area – the smallest of the three partly surviving lime kilns at Kingston, Lime-Kiln 3, is thought to date from the First Penal Settlement;</li>
                            <li>Arthur’s Vale retains visible evidence of the cropping patterns and the channel modifications (Watermill Creek) of the First Penal period. A section of the channel remains in its First Penal settlement alignment. There is also likely to be archaeological evidence of stream modifications and damming and of general agricultural use and possibly structures such as benching and huts. The construction of the Second Penal Settlement dam would have removed remains of the earlier dam except perhaps the earthworks; and</li>
                            <li>The Government House sites.</li>
