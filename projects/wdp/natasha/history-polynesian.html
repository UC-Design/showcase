                        <p><em>Norfolk Island, at the time of Cook's discovery in 1774, was uninhabited with no outward evidence of the Island's having been previously occupied, but Europeans were not the first people to inhabit Norfolk Island...</em></p>
                        <p>Evidence indicating that Norfolk Island had been inhabited prior to the European occupation in 1788 was recognised in the first year of settlement by Lieutenant Governor King. Plantain bananas were found growing in Arthur's Vale, suggesting human intervention. By 1791, stone tools had been discovered in the interior of the Island providing further proof of former habitation. In the 1840s a skull and ‘stone axe’ were found during earthworks. Through the twentieth century, evidence of stone tool making in the form of adze blanks and basalt flakes were found at Emily Bay, and later, similar adzes were found at both Emily and Slaughter Bays within KAVHA.</p>
                        <p>Archaeological investigations have unearthed artefact assemblages, structural remains which have been interpreted as a rudimentary marae (a religious structure commonly encountered in East Polynesia) and evidence of landscape modifications in the Emily Bay area. The assemblage is characteristic of East Polynesian culture. Radiocarbon dating indicates Polynesian settlement of the area occurred between AD 1200 and AD 1600.</p>
