                <h4>2.1 From Tocumwal to Canberra</h4>
                <p>
                    After the Second World War, the development of Canberra as the national capital was revitalised. The final move of central
                    Commonwealth administration from Melbourne to Canberra involved thousands of people and a huge building
                    program that included the creation of new suburbs as well as offices, schools and all the general city
                    infrastructure. In its quest to meet the growing housing needs of Canberra at a time of extreme shortage
                    of building materials the National Capital Planning and Development Committee was interested in available
                    prefabricated houses. The transportation of a number of the Tocumwal houses and their installation in
                    Ainslie and O'Connor was arranged. In Ainslie they were located in various streets amongst other types
                    of housing, but in O'Connor they were established in a specific location that is now the O'Connor Tocumwal
                    heritage precinct. Jim Perry was the builder who won the contract to install the houses in O'Connor.

                    <p>
                        I lived near the Murray Valley Highway. I remember seeing houses in sections going along the highway on big trucks. The Murray
                        Valley Highway was really narrow and they seemed to take up all of the road. I knew they came from
                        Tocumwal but I didn't know where they were going. We saw them frequently. It wasn't until many years
                        later that I found out where their journeys ended.

                    John Barty was employed as a carpenter on the construction of houses at the Tocumwal air force base. Like Stanley Forster
                    he was in the Civil Construction Corps during the war. He travelled as far afield as the Northern Territory
                    doing this work. After the war, he was attracted by the building work opportunities in Canberra and he
                    and his family moved to Canberra from Finley in 1947. One of the first jobs he was employed on was re-erecting
                    the Tocumwal houses in Ainslie. In 1953 the Barty's were allocated a Tocumwal house in Todd Street, O'Connor.

                    <p>
                        Owen Taverner and his partners Billy Moore and Billy Goggin had the contract with Jim Perry to build the footings and chimneys
                        for '100 Tocumwal cottages in O'Connor'. They were the 'very first things to be built past the pines'
                        (Haig Park). There was no road beyond Haig Park - they'd get through on tracks. 'From Haig Park to
                        the end of Turner was dirt.'

                        One of the things that amazed Owen about the houses was that they were erected without concrete foundations. 'I'll bet you
                        any money you like, there's nowhere else like that in Canberra'. They laid the bricks straight on
                        to the ground - two courses sideways in trenches that were dug for them by the contractor, and the
                        footings on top. 'We often wondered about that, but the houses are all still there.'

                    <p>
                        Jim Perry was the builder. He had the contract to erect the Tocumwal houses. But Owen remembers that 'to all intents and
                        purposes Tommy O'Connor was the main man' - he was from Queanbeyan - O'Connor constructions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Owen and his partners worked on the contract for about six months and he remembers that the forty hour week came in towards
                        the end of the contract - 1948.
