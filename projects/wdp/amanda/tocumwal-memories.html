                    <h3 id="s1">Long term residents</h3>
                    <p>In the mid-1990s when the collection of material for the Tocumwal Archive began there were still a number of long term residents in the O'Connor Tocumwal houses, some of whom were the original tenants.</p>
                    <p>I don't ever want to go</p>
                    <p>When we came there wasn't a thing out this way</p>
                    <p>There was a big black stump over the street there </p>
                    <p>Right in the middle of the two way street </p>
                    <p>And the children used to play in it and get covered with charcoal. </p>
                    <p>The best baby sitter I ever had was an old magpie that used to sit up on a big dead stump on the corner of </p>
                    <p>Miller and Macarthur </p>
                    <p>Every time the children got to the corner it used to swoop down on them </p>
                    <p>It knew!</p>
                    <p>We used to push the pram with the kids in to do the shopping at Civic - and bring it home in the pram </p>
                    <p>Usually the day after you got paid </p>
                    <p>It was the only shopping centre</p>
                    <p>Mr Cosier was at the corner store </p>
                    <p>After he sold up and went away they built the whole front right along </p>
                    <p>There was a little clothing shop - Macdonald's - past the chemist shop - where (Marinetti's) is now </p>
                    <p>We used to use it quite a lot</p>
                    <p>My girls and George's (George Lewis) girls all went to school together </p>
                    <p>We used to go down to Turner School for Sunday School </p>
                    <p>And they all went from there to St Phillips - at the youth centre there </p>
                    <p>Both my girls were married at St Phillips </p>
                    <p>And my husband was buried from there. </p>
                    <p>I remember when we put the first stone in for the Church </p>
                    <p>I still do morning teas once a month.</p>
                    <p>We knew all our neighbours </p>
                    <p>But they're all changed now </p>
                    <p>The LeGrand's had the art gallery </p>
                    <p>The Macmillans were on the corner of Way Street </p>
                    <p>The Crosses were in Miller Street for years </p>
                    <p>Neighbours didn't get together for functions</p>
                    <p>But we did things like swapping vegetables - and we still do </p>
                    <p>George and I are often swapping things</p>
                    <p>And George is very handy if you want anything fixed</p>
                    <p>We had a fire in the lounge room </p>
                    <p>And a wood stove in the kitchen</p>
                    <p>That was all the heating we had.</p>
                    <p>The front part's the same as it always was </p>
                    <p>I had the new and bigger windows put in because they were push out windowns and were always breaking </p>
                    <p>And I got a hot water service in the bathroom </p>
                    <p>When we moved in we had a chip heater - that was alright when we had the wood</p>
                    <p>When my husband was alive he wouldn't buy the house </p>
                    <p>But after he died they put the rents up - about $100 per fortnight</p>
                    <p>So I bought it and put the extra 100 into the house instead of the rent </p>
                    <p>It's all paid for now</p>
                    <p>Now I have three girls living with me - two have been here for two years </p>
                    <p>Before that I had other students - most of them were from the country </p>
                    <p>It's company for me in the house </p>
                    <p>I had one come and visit me a little while ago - she'd lived here for about nine years </p>
                    <p>Any of them, if they're around they always come and see me</p>
                    <p>We were the third people in this house</p>
                    <p>I've been here about 45 years </p>
                    <p>And I don't ever want to go </p>
                    <p>When I first saw the house I loved it </p>
                    <p>A real home place </p>
                    <p>My granddaughter says to me now </p>
                    <p>'Don't ever sell it Gran or we'll have nowhere to call home'</p>
                    <p>I like it here because it's handy to everything </p>
                    <p>And I've been here - you get to know your way around places </p>
                    <p>I don't think I'd like to move anywhere else</p>

                    <h3 id="s2">The story of Studio Nundah - Macarthur Avenue</h3>
                    <p>In 1950 my father and mother emigrated to Sydney from Holland where they had been in partnership in a pottery business in Amsterdam.</p>
                    <p>I expect it would have been in 1951 or 52, after I was born, that the old man got a job with East Sydney Tech. and was posted to Canberra to teach ceramics at the new Canberra technical college which at first was over in the old Kingston buildings, where the bus shelters are. In this capacity he helped establish the first art school here in Canberra.</p>
                    <p>For the first couple of years he commuted from Sydney to Canberra on an old BSA motorbike but then he was allocated the Macarthur Avenue house and that became our home in about 1954 or 55.</p>
                    <p>The pottery studio at the back of the Macarthur Avenue house was built by my father with the aid of Jack Ketley, the head of the Electrical Trades, and a number of other people involved in the trade areas of the Tech. The arrangement was that he would make them a dinner service in exchange for their help.</p>
                    <p>My father and mother separated in 1962, and as we were struggling on the meagre sum awarded her by the Court for maintenance, she started running pottery classes in the studio several mornings and evenings a week. In the same year she opened what is believed to be the first commercial art gallery in Canberra - Studio Nundah.</p>
                    <p>The gallery ran in the front three rooms of the house, so we all ended up living in the other two remaining bedrooms and the kitchen until 1965 when my mother went into a very brief partnership which facilitated a loan for the extension to the gallery.</p>
                    <p>The extension was designed by Theo Bischoff and the architectural drawings were done by Neil Renfrey. It included lots of blank wall space for the hanging of paintings. Other features were an innovative system of pelmeting, charcoal black ceilings with spot-lights, hessian-coloured walls and polished wooden floors - it was all very spiffy. There was a large patio built in slate and the garden was redesigned somewhat to accommodate sculpture.</p>
                    <p>With the regularity of openings - the show would be on for 2 weeks, then it would be pull down, pack up, receive the new goods and set up, so you might have an opening about every three or four weeks - there was a lot of coming and going at Macarthur Avenue during my teenage years. For openings, particularly winter openings, we'd serve Gluwein and there'd be a coterie of individuals, supporters of the gallery, who would stay back and party on. There was a lot of camaraderie and support because Canberra was still so small.</p>
                    <p>My Father got an MBE for his contribution to the arts but I also think it would have been nice if my mother had got something like that. She had a policy of exhibiting younger artists, people like Geoff Makin, who had recently graduated from East Sydney Tech., and I notice here in one of the visitors' books that there was a show of contemporary prints by Arthur Wicks who's now a well-established artist. To maintain the viability of the gallery in relation to this policy my mother put on exhibitions of landscapes which sold very well.</p>
                    <p>As a consequence of all her activities - the gallery, kids' classes in the school holidays, raising a family by herself, my mother's own work didn't get much of a look-in. She did do some of it but, like any artist might tell you, unless you have unfettered time, it's very hard. She ended up being a good listener for a number of individuals. She was a very accommodating person and she worked her butt off with little or no financial reward.</p>
                    <p>I think it was about 1972 that the gallery closed down. My mother stayed on at Macarthur Avenue until she died in 1985. I'm curious to see now that since Fine Line have sold it, there's a consulting psychologist there. It seems somehow appropriate given the role my mother played there for so many people. She always used to say if the walls could speak ...</p>

                    <h3 id="s3">My life with the ponies and horses</h3>
                    <p>We arrived in Australia in 1966 and bought this house in Quinn Street, O'Connor. The house, a Tocumwal type, had a huge back yard. There were all types of fruit trees, pencil pines and nut trees growing. But it was the large block off the beaten track that attracted me. Through the big hedge onto the nature strip, up over Miller Street and you were in the scrub within three minutes on a good pony.</p>
                    <p>Our family of three kids ranged from 11 months to five years - the youngest was our son James. My brother and his wife were with us until they bought their place at 3 Peel Street in 1967.</p>
                    <p>Our first pony mare had a foal at foot when she came to us. The foal (Danny Boy) turned out to be a top child's pony - not only my kids but many more from our area were educated on Danny in the paddock. He was the first of many as we have two horses in the yards up till this very day.</p>
                    <p>Looking back over the 30 years we have been here, the people in this area call it the horse paddock. We have a beaut walled in play area. The three pre-schools in the area parade past the big horse gate every week and on the 1st of August, the horses' birthday, we find the gate with birthday greetings to Danny, Model and Dillon pinned to it.</p>
                    <p>Many people in passing have always said to me "It is good to see the rural scene in the suburban areas". Needless to say, all our neighbours around have good rose beds.</p>
                    <p>Our house took on a new lease of life as I am a retired carpenter and joiner and have over the years renovated and extended the Quinn Street house. Still to this day new bits and pieces are on the go.</p>
                    <p>We are very happy in Quinn Street and get regular visits from our five grandchildren. We have had the same neighbours the 30 years we have lived here.</p>

                    <h3 id="s4">The past and the present</h3>
                    <p>In the mid-1990s the Tocumwal houses precinct in O'Connor was nominated for listing on the ACT Heritage Register and is now a listed heritage precinct. Most of the remaining government houses have been sold and land values have increased considerably. People moving into the area often have an interest in the distinctive architectural features of the houses and their restoration. The Tocumwal houses are weatherboard to sill height, AC sheet fibro above with small timber framed windows of two to four vertical panes. Roofs are hipped and sheeted with corrugated iron. They have large lounge rooms, typically with double doors opening into the dining room, generous verandahs and red brick chimneys. As a result of private owernship, some of the houses were dramatically modified prior to heritage listing, but the streetscape view remains fairly consistent. Typically the houses have either three or four bedrooms. A small number, in Quinn, Peel and Macpherson streets, have two bedrooms. These did not come from Tocumwal but were built as look-alikes to complete the precinct by the government's workforce, rather than by Jim Perry.</p>
                    <p>(Information from The O'Connor precinct design criteria, prepared by ACT Public Works for ACT Housing Trust, George Lewis - an original Tocumwal resident, and member of the government day labour force)</p>

                    <h3 id="s5">Nothing that will alter the original character of the house</h3>
                    <p>There are not many houses in Canberra of charm and character - at least not many that we could afford to consider. But once we became aware of the Tocumwals in O'Connor they seemed to fit the bill perfectly.</p>
                    <p>We liked the look of this house from the outset: the big corrugated iron roof, the timber floors, the roomy interior spaces, and the general country farmhouse appearance. And we were delighted to find a Tocumwal that was so intact with its original casement windows and Tasmanian oak doors, the functioning fireplace in the lounge, even the Canberra Metters slow combustion stove that Mrs Heycox, the former resident, had reputedly used to such effect for the last forty years. We could also see the possiblities of the odd triangular-shaped block for creating a wonderful garden. The fact that it was rather bare and empty didn't seem to be a problem. After all there was an old quince and that magnificent mature fig tree - everyone who walks past reminds us about the colourful scarecrow that used to hang there every year. (We even found Mrs Heycox's recipe for preserved figs in the kitchen cupboard when we moved in.)</p>
                    <p>What are we going to do with our house in the future? Well not a great deal really apart from some TLC. The garden is one of our priorities and we have already spent quite a bit of time and energy making a start in that direction. Some painting of course, a wooden deck down one side to enjoy the garden, and perhaps extending the front verandah. Nothing that will alter the original character of the house. In fact we are quite pleased about the heritage listing - at least this part of O'Connor will be protected from the threat of predatory developers! We are also hoping that the recommendations of the traffic study will be implemented in the near future so that Miller Street becomes a bit quieter.</p>
                    <p>As new arrivals we have thoroughly enjoyed becoming acquainted with the neighbourhood and we have been especially pleased to get to know some of our neighbours who have been part of the Tocumwal precinct from its early days. We regard this as a part of inner Canberra with a distinctive history and we are looking forward to living here into the forseeable future.</p>

                    <p>Walking around the garden:</p>
                    <p>Mum planted that camelia - she paid 2/6 for it at Queanbeyan.</p>
                    <p>What colour is it?</p>
                    <p>Snowy white.</p>
                    <p>And the rhododendron?</p>
                    <p>Pink.</p>
                    <p>And the camelia around the other side?</p>
                    <p>Light pink.</p>
                    <p>I left that grapevine there because I was going to graft it with the grape that's got no seeds </p>
                    <p>Anyway I got grafted myself. </p>
                    <p>This one here - coastal magnolia </p>
                    <p>Mum planted it as a stick </p>
                    <p>Just an ordinary stick </p>
                    <p>I said, 'Don't plant it there, it might grow' </p>
                    <p>She said, 'That's the idea.' </p>
                    <p>This is a lemon meyer </p>
                    <p>Actually it wants pruning now </p>
                    <p>Get rid of some of the old wood </p>
                    <p>I picked four or five cases of fruit of this one year </p>
                    <p>And cherries - don't talk about cherries </p>
                    <p>That one up there, he come up by himself </p>
                    <p>Someone threw a seed over the fence. </p>
                    <p>This one I bought in Young - I was after a big black one. </p>
                    <p>That's a damson plum - it was here when we arrived </p>
                    <p>You can dry them </p>
                    <p>And the fig tree </p>
                    <p>I pinched that </p>
                    <p>There was another one over here </p>
                    <p>A big black one - I got that from Adelaide </p>
                    <p>I think the kids must've taken it. </p>
                    <p>That fig tree is a little one</p>
                    <p>They make lovely jam </p>
                    <p>And you can dry them</p>
                    <p>We're going to put a vegie garden in there where that pile of dirt is </p>
                    <p>And some fruit trees - apple and pear </p>
                    <p>And espalier them along the fence. </p>
                    <p>Was there a shed here?</p>
                    <p>No, there was a trellis - </p>
                    <p>Grapes - black muscat. </p>
                    <p>I grew a lot of vegetables here </p>
                    <p>When I first come here </p>
                    <p>The kids were younger then </p>
                    <p>Had to get a bit of chaff somewhere.</p>
                    <p>How many kids did you have?</p>
                    <p>Eight.</p>
                    <p>On the verandah over a cup of tea</p>
                    <p>This was Mum's spot </p>
                    <p>She had all pot plants here </p>
                    <p>You couldn't walk here </p>
                    <p>And there was mesh all the way down to protect the pot plants.</p>
                    <p>We've been using the old stove in the kitchen - </p>
                    <p>We had a flue put in.</p>
                    <p>I tell you what, with that fire going in there </p>
                    <p>Oh, it's as warm as toast </p>
                    <p>Oh Jesus </p>
                    <p>I didn't want to get out of here.</p>
                    <p>The walnut tree</p>
                    <p>By gee it's a lovely shape </p>
                    <p>There's many a Christmas,as we had under that </p>
                    <p>There's a bloke said, 'I'll give you a thousand dollars for the tree' </p>
                    <p>I said, 'You bring me the thousand dollars </p>
                    <p>And you can take the tree' </p>
                    <p>He never turned up </p>
                    <p>He wanted the wood for furniture </p>
                    <p>Look at the limbs </p>
                    <p>There's only one month of the year you can cut them </p>
                    <p>Otherwise they loose too much sap </p>
                    <p>You should see that tree in the mornings when the nuts are nearly ripe </p>
                    <p>It's not this colour </p>
                    <p>It's white with cockatoos </p>
                    <p>One in their mouth and one in their foot </p>
                    <p>Drop some on my roof on the way over </p>
                    <p>And away up to Black Mountain</p>
