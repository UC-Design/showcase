BallCall app has been created with and for my daughter(6years).
It is meant to encourage her to read and deal with larger numbers s well as be fun it also trains her eye to recognise colour/saturation/hues differences.
The app revolves around a rhyme she made and shorter version can be seen on scroll down.
Functionally, everything revolves around the ball. 
The control buttons can slide in and slide out to enable the user to view their creation. Multiple controls can be selected(the colour changes when control is selected) thus allowing for endless number of combinations. 
Size, Color (Hue, Saturation, Black Background and Troll face) can all be selected in any order.
Note: If selecting troll - hover on the ball to activate troll hiding. it will then only appear on hover.(this was done to indicate that the troll is indeed there once the appropriate setting was selected. After multiple interactions it was decided that default should be a showing troll until mouse hover(sometimes she wants take pics of the created troll).
This provided much entertainment to family and her friends(even in development stage) And will be extended in future.
I hope you enjoy it too!

Regards, 
Lydia.
