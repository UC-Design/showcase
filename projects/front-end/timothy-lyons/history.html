                <h4>history:</h4>
                <p>Churchill House was built by the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia. The Trust began consideration of erecting a building of its own in 1967 and formed a building committee in 1968. In 1969 it acquired a lease for land on Northbourne Avenue, the current site, and engaged the architect Robin Boyd to design the building. The building was to provide offices for the Trust and in addition was to provide rental office accommodation for commercial tenants as a means of generating income for the Trust. Features of the original design included: a glass exhibition pavilion, on the site of the current north wing, which housed a display on the work of the Trust; the flat roof area of the east and south wings which was intended to be a roof terrace; and accommodation in the building included a board room, dining room, reception area, bar and kitchen.</p>

                <p>Churchill House displays several key features of the Late Twentieth Century Brutalist style as follows: Large areas of blank wall, especially the west wall of the south wing; Off-form concrete, such as the west wall of the south wing and the spandrels to the south and east wings. In addition, it displays a number of the other features of this style: Sloping structural fins, being the structural steel members supporting the glazing at the corner between the east and south wings; Precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, being the cladding to the wings facing the pool area; Precast fins for sun protection, as above; Vertical slit windows, also being a part of the cladding to the wings facing the pool area.</p>

                <p>The cost of the works was about $1 million. The building was officially opened on 14 April 1972. Boyd died in 1971 before completion, and W K Williams was engaged by the Trust as its site representative to replace Boyd.</p>

                <p>Churchill House is one of a number of Canberra buildings designed in the Late Twentieth Century Brutalist style. These include:</p>

                <p>Churchill House is an early example in this context, and one of only two examples of an office building. While Brutalism has been described as an ethic rather than an aesthetic (Banham 1966:10), both office buildings display a more restrained form compared to the other buildings, several of which were intended to portray a distinctive image in the national capital.</p>
