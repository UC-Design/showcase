                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p class="col_left">
                        <span class="drop_cap">C</span>hurchill House, at 216 Northbourne Avenue in Braddon, was designed by Robin Boyd for the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia in 1969-70, and construction was completed in 1971. It was Boyd’s last major commission, and he died prior to its completion.
                        
                    <strong class="full_width">It is one of a small number of larger designs produced by Boyd and was Canberra’s first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutalist_architecture" target="_blank">brutalist</a> building.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p class="col_right">
                        Several components make up the complex. The main building, with east and south wings; the separate north wing or pavilion; the central pool and a rear carpark. The main building forms an L shape and with the north wing it encloses a courtyard with a large ornamental pool. The main building is three storeys high with a four storey lift tower at the southeast corner. The north wing and the carpark are two storeyed.
                    </p>
                    
                    
                    <p class="full_width">
                        Although it has undergone some alterations over the years, the building still displays key features of the brutalist style with its large areas of blank wall and use off-form concrete, sloping structural fins and precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, precast fins for sun protection, and vertical slit windows. Churchill House displays a fairly restrained form in comparison with the major Canberra buildings that followed in this style: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Offices,_Belconnen" target="_blank">Cameron Offices,</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Gallery_of_Australia" target="_blank">National Gallery of Australia</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Australia" target="_blank">High Court of Australia.</a>

                <h2>Statement of Significace</h2>
                    <p>Churchill House is a good example of the Late Twentieth Century Brutalist style, (1960-), displaying several key features as follows:</p>
                    
                <ul>
                    <li>Large areas of blank wall, especially the west wall of the south wing.</li>
                    <li>Off-form concrete, such as the west wall of the south wing and the spandrels to the south and east wings.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p class="col_left">In addition, it displays a number of the other features of this style including: sloping structural fins, precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, precast fins for sun protection, and vertical slit windows. Churchill House is one of several Canberra examples of this style, and one of only two which display a restrained form reflecting, perhaps, a more conservative approach to the style because of the intended office use.</p>
                <p class="col_right">The architecture of this building may contribute to the education of designers in their understanding of Late Twentieth-Century Architectural Styles.</p>
                <p class="col_right">Churchill House has interest for its association with the prominent architect, Robin Boyd. The building was his last major commission.</p>
