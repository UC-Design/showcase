            <h3 class=oheading>Overview</h3>

            <p class="overview">The building is an example of the Late Twentieth-Century Brutalist Style (1960's) with its large areas of blank wall and off-form concrete. Several components make up the complex. The main building, with east and south wings; the separate north wing or pavilion; the central pool and a rear carpark. The main building forms an L shape and with the north wing it encloses a courtyard with a large ornamental pool. The main building is three storeys high with a four storey lift tower at the southeast corner. The north wing and the carpark are two storeys</p>

            <h3 class="build">Building today</h3>

            <p class="build">Although it has undergone some alterations over the years, the building still displays key features of the brutalist style with its large areas of blank wall and use off-form concrete, sloping structural fins and precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, precast fins for sun protection, and vertical slit windows. Churchill House displays a fairly restrained form in comparison with the major Canberra buildings that followed in this style: <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Offices,_Belconnen>Cameron Offices</a>, <a href=https://nga.gov.au/aboutus/building/history.cfm>National Gallery of Australia</a> and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Australia>High Court of Australia</a>. </p> </div> </main> <footer>
