            <h2>Brutalist style</h2>



            <p>Churchill House is one of a number of Canberra buildings designed in the Late Twentieth Century Brutalist style. These include: </p>


            <ul>
                <li><a href=https://nga.gov.au/aboutus/building/history.cfm>National Gallery of Australia</a>, 1971;</li> <li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Offices,_Belconnen>Cameron Offices</a>, 1976;</li> <li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANU_School_of_Music>Canberra School of Music</a>, 1976; and</li> <li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Australia>High Court of Australia</a>, 1980.</li> </ul> <p>Churchill House is an early example in this context, and one of only two examples of an office building. While Brutalism has been described as an ethic rather than an aesthetic, both office buildings display a more restrained form compared to the other buildings, several of which were intended to portray a distinctive image in the national capital.
                                    </p>



                                    <p>Several key features include:</p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Large areas of blank wall, especially the west wall of the south wing.</li>

                                        <li>Off-form concrete, such as the west wall of the south wing and the spandrels to the south and east wings.</li>

                                    </ul>

                                    <p>In addition, it displays a number of the other features of this style.</p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Sloping structural fins, being the structural steel members supporting the glazing at the corner between the east and south wings.</li>

                                        <li>Precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, being the cladding to the wings facing the pool area.</li>

                                        <li>Precast fins for sun protection, as above.</li>

                                        <li>Vertical slit windows, also being a part of the cladding to the wings facing the pool area.</li>
                                    </ul>
