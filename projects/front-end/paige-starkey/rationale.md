# Project 2 - Rationale
For this project, we had to build a architecture website based on a client brief. Below is my design rationale.

You can view this rationale in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/az6OQVbsbGhmmVAmjZ5EcY/Front-end-web-design?node-id=109%3A502&viewport=-8591%2C-2221%2C0.2639991343021393&scaling=min-zoom), along with the comparsion between my original concepts and final design.
## Overall design
As mentioned in project 1, I wanted to capture the brutalist nature of Churchill House, while staying true to Robyn Boyd’s mid-century style. To me, this meant bold fonts and clean lines. I also wanted to capture the feeling that you were picking up a coffee table book, which resulted me in moving away slightly from my original design.

For example, I didn’t want to have a large image hero image on my content pages, because although a full page image is often featured in publications, it is often in a spread of 2 pages, and doesn’t take away from the content. I wanted it to be clear what ‘chapter’ the user was reading, which resulted in a large h1. By putting myself in my audiences shoes, I knew that if I had made my way to pages such as ‘history’, my only focus wasn’t just images, it was the story behind Churchill House. That being said, I still wanted to make sure images were appropriately featured.

I did keep the two-column layout for tablet+ from my original low-fidelity prototype, which also reflects that layout style of the Robin Boyd Collection site. I opted to remove the blockquotes from final design after reviewing blockquote best practice, and found it didn’t apply to this content.

## Font family and colours
In project 1, I stated I wanted to stick to san-serif fonts to fit the brutalist theme. However, upon further research into coffee table books and publication best practice, I decided to use san-serif for the heading and serif for the body text. The reason behind this is because serif fonts assist with readability in publications (although not necessarily the best for screen readability, but I wanted to stick with a theme!)

I decided to stick to dark grey and white for the primary colours, again to meet the publication theme and allow for good contrast for readability. Using a dark grey over black emulates what a user would see in real life—there are very few things that are 100% black. My feature colour (tan) has been used for links to provide the user with a visual representation links within the document, since I had removed the default underline.

## Responsive design
I knew some basic responsive techniques going into this unit, and I decided to use these techniques rather than spending the time to properly understand better techniques such as flexbox. As a result, my website is responsive, but the code is messy in some places.

Although it’s not considered best practice, I decided to keep the hamburger menu across all screen sizes. This was to keep with the ‘publication’ theme as I didn’t wanted to overcrowd with information that wouldn’t be standard in a publication—the table of contents isn’t on content pages. Changing from the icon to ‘Menu’ was to cater for older audiences who may not be aware of what a hamburger menu is.
